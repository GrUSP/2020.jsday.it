     From the olden days of DOS, Gil was, is, and always will be a software developer. He has co-founded WebCollage, survived the bubble
     collapses, and designed cloudy projects at Wix. His current passion is figuring out how to test software,
     a passion which he has turned into his main job as Senior Architect at Applitools, where he develops tests for software
     that tests software, which is almost one meta layer too many for him.
