  title: 'Responsible responsive typography: a crash-course on variable fonts and accessibility'
  extract: >
    Variable fonts are here and we can now create complex and scalable typographic system quickly and efficiently. An
    efficiency that can easily help us improving the performance and the accessibility our web projects. Sounds incredible
    right? But with great power comes a series of responsibilities: let's see how we can balance accessibility needs,
    performance requirements and creativity to deliver accessible and inclusive reading experiences using variable fonts.

  title: 'Four Pillars and a Base: The Nuts and Bolts of a Monorepo'
  extract: >
    Everybody’s talking about them, but nobody’s doing them. Well, we took up the challenge, and are.
    What I am going to show is how we implemented a Monorepo project, and why. The nuts and bolts of creating a repo based on npm packages,
    the structure of the code of the apps in the monorepo, and creating packages with the common code.
    Also, and maybe most importantly, how we test the whole thing, how we build the project, how we deploy it in production,
    and how we monitor it. It’s going to be a really boring talk, full of lots of tips we learned in blood in the last year of
    implementing this. So be prepared to be bored! And, hopefully, educated…

  title: 'Building CLI Tools With NodeJS'
  extract: >
    Nobody questions building back ends with NodeJS anymore. It’s proven itself and is widely accepted as a great platform for web servers.
    But have you ever thought of building CLI tools with NodeJS? Turns out that NodeJS is also great at that.
    By using just a few simple built-in modules, you can create powerful tools that can be used in terminals in all operating systems.
    In this talk, the attendees will learn how to use those modules through some practical code samples and demos.

  title: 'How vulnerable is your App? and how to fix it.'
  extract: >
    The essence of this talk is enlightening frontend developers of security risks, how to spot them and fix them.
    The techniques discussed in this talk are framework agnostic so it can be applied to all JS frameworks, from my
    research a lot of companies lose money because security is an afterthought or some think they are too small to
    be attacked and sometimes it just wasn't properly implemented. I intend to start from the known to the less known
    security considerations and walk the audience through this in such a way that beginners are also carried along.

  title: 'Packages for Mass Consumption - an npm story unfolded'
  extract: >
    Master the delicate nuances and deep impact of your app’s dependencies. Uncover the mysterious ways in which npm
    dependencies work, the mechanics of lockfiles, and understand the security risks of an entire ecosystem. This talk
    will unravel multiple dimensions in which our application relies on dependencies, and present best practices for
    ideal developer experience and team collaboration workflows.

  title: 'Build a community, not a framework'
  extract: >
    You are watching from the sides, dreaming about building the next (popular?) framework or library in your field. You dream about presenting your creation in front of hundreds of people at OpenJS World. You believe in yourself, and suddenly you have thousands of downloads per month and developers relying on you to maintain your library. You think you’ve made it. Instead, it is only the beginning.
    What makes an Open Source library or framework successful? Does something become popular because it’s technologically superior, or shows a clear innovation path? A single maintainer can only do so much, dividing their time between adding new features, fixing bugs and updating dependencies.
    Maintaining a successful Open Source project is a big burden for a single individual, often working on their own time. You need something else - you need a community.

  title: 'Flying a drone with twitter, bananas & Web APIs'
  extract: >
    The web is fast becoming the main means through which people interact with all sorts of technologies. With every
    new invention, users ask "but can it work with a browser?" With Web APIs, the answer is almost always yes; even to
    the question "can you fly a drone with a banana?" In this talk, I show the audience the power of APIs and discuss a
    few cool experimental APIs. I do this by taking them through on a journey through my experience of trying to hack
    a drone and fly it with a banana. If you're interested in all things web, custom controllers, Bluetooth technology
    and accelerometer-based controls or if you just like fruit and seeing silly applications of technology, this talk
    is for you.

  title: 'Testing in Production'
  extract: >
    Testing in production is the only way to know that your software is working right now in production. It not only
    increases developer confidence in the code, but also increases development velocity because you will spend less
    time fixing bugs and more time building new products. This approach provides an increased accuracy of test results,
    faster test execution time due to elimination of bad data, and you will have higher confidence before releases
    because you already know that your features will work before you launch. I will show you how to mitigate risk,
    improve your understanding of the steps to get there, and shift your company’s testing culture to provide the best
    possible experience to your users. I will talk about the way to run tests in the production environment of a system,
    how to do it without disrupting real end users, and how to exclude testing data from data and analytics. I will also
    talk about the tools that help in this process, the benefits of testing in production, why the pros outweigh the cons,
    and why it's more reliable.

  title: 'How to do Good Without Doing Anything'
  extract: >
    There’s no arguing that building accessible websites is a force for good. Everyone, regardless of ability or 
    disability, ought to have the right to participate on the web. But ensuring that our websites and apps work for
    everyone can be time consuming and isn’t always easy to get right. Luckily, like most things in programming,
    investing a little bit of extra time on your accessibility workflow and setting up a series of automated tools
    will end up saving you tons of time and energy in the long run. In this talk I will lay out a set of processes
    that can reduce your time spent identifying, debugging and testing accessibility support in your applications. I
    will discuss the ways that I automate certain aspects of my development workflows to catch accessibility errors,
    define and set up e2e tests for accessibility and go through the entire lifecycle of accessibility feature development
    using a real world example.
